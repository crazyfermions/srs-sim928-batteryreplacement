## About

This is a guide on how to replace the batteries inside a [Stanford Research Systems SIM928 Rechargeable Isolated Voltage Source](https://www.thinksrs.com/products/sim928.html). The SIM928 is a battery driven voltage source which has two groups of rechargable 9V batteries where one group powers the voltage source while the other is being recharged. After one group is depleted, the device switches to the other group and charges the depleted one. Since the lifetimes of the batteries is quite limited, the batteries have to be exchanged quite often.

## Contents

The [basic guide](doc.rst) is just a single document. It is recommended to be read with a rst renderer, since it contains some images, for example directly on github. There is also the possibility to make an html document with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) with `make`.
